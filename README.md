# Replication Package for Dissertation: “Leveraging Evolutionary Changes for Software Process Quality” [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7981673.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7981673)

This repository holds all the material and results for reproducing the
tables, figures, and in-text results of my dissertation (Hönel 2023).

In this repository, you will find:

- [**Notebooks** (R)](./notebooks) - Notebooks that can be (re-)run by
  users to reproduce the results. All results are included, such that
  the notebooks will only recompute them if you delete them. The
  notebooks are very detailed and document all steps necessary.
  - [**Replication Package for All Results, Figures, and
    Tables**](./notebooks/Replication.md) - The primary notebook of this
    repository.
- [**Results** (RDS)](./results) - All data required for reproduction is
  included. All the results, too. Some of these may take a long time to
  compute, so be aware.
